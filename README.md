# Vim Configuration

My configuration files for Vim. Tuned to play nice with MacVim. Setup using homesick for symlinkin' goodness.


## Installation Notes

Add some info about installing and/or forking..


## Custom Configurations

Add info about nodelint, markdown, snipmate and other specific customizations..


## Updating The Configuration

As a reminder to update the configuration do the following:

1. close down MacVim
- `cd ~/.homesick/repos/vimfiles/`
- `cd home/.vim/bundle/snipmate.vim`
- `git fetch upstream master`
- `git merge upstream/master`
- `git push push master` on the following:
  - `bundle/markdown-preview.vim`
  - `bundle/browser-refresh.vim`
  - `bundle/snipmate.vim`
  - `syntax_checkers/compilers/nodelint-config/`
- `cd ~/.homesick/repos/vimfiles/`
- `$ bash update`
- commit the changes

`$ bash update` will handle cleaning out tags generated by help docs, pull any upstream changes from the submodules, and open gitx so you can add commit messages and make sure there isn't any damage done on the pulled upstream changes. It looks like:

    git submodule foreach git checkout master
    git submodule foreach git clean -f
    git submodule foreach git pull --rebase
    gitx


## Editor Themes

Add some info about the themes..


## Submodules ##

A few notes for future reference about working with `git submodules` taken from [cheat sheets][cheat-sheets].


### Adding Submodules: ###

    git submodule add <remote_repository> <path/to/submodule>
    git submodule init
    git submodule update


### Updating Submodules ###

    git submodule foreach <command>


### Removing Submodules ###

   1. Delete the relevant line from the `.gitmodules` file
   2. Delete the relevant section from `.git/config`
   3. Run `git rm --cached path_to_submodule` (no trailing slash)


### Working With Your Own Submodules

In order to keep your personal submodules available to forks but allow commits back to the upstream master repository from within the submodule:

1. Create the repository for your bundle within git
-  Then from the `vimfiles` directory add the submodule as you would any other submodule
-  Within your newly created submodule, create a remote reference to the upstream master repository
-  Make changes to the submodule and push updates back to the remote upstream master
-  Then whenever you pull updates to all of your submodules, you as well as everyone else should get the changes

Here is an example:
  
    cd ~/.homesick/repos/vimfiles/
    git submodule add git://github.com/mkitt/submodule-name.vim.git home/.vim/bundle/submodule-name.vim
    cd home/.vim/bundle/submodule-name.vim/
    git remote add push git@github.com:mkitt/submodule-name.vim.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Then whenever you make changes to the submodule:

    cd ~/.homesick/repos/vimfiles/home/.vim/bundle/submodule-name.vim/
    git push push master

This allows you to make changes directly in your submodule, see the effects and push the changes back without maintaining multiple repositories and linking them back and forth. [Defunkt][defunkt] has a good article about [working with submodules][defunkt-subs].


## Todo

The following should be completed shortly:

- Dial in Objective C work flow as a replacement for Xcode
- Dial in ActionScript work flow and snippets (put the final nail in the coffin for TextMate and Eclipse)
- Vim Cheat Sheet for my settings
- Move User specific settings to an ignored after file or a plugin?
- Further additions to .vimrc for language settings from DP and GV
- Create the snowblind, greyblind and sunblind themes


## License and Contributions ##

All licensing for the Bundles/Plugins should be found in their respective repositories. Anything written by me is of course open source through MIT. While contributions are welcome, you're probably better off forking and tuning it to your own machine.
